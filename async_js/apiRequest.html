<!-- API data was requested into the javascript via XMLHttpRequest
 Though fetch() and promise is used nowadays it was a very powerful interface availabe in web workers
 use of the async functionality either by using fetch or XMLHttpRequest is called AJAX technique
 you can use as an example github apis(https://api.github.com/users/JatinChauhan108)
 or use https://randomuser.me/ to get random api data
 you can use a JSON formatter on the internet to easily understand the api data -->
